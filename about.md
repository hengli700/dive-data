### About me

<p>
Hi there :wave:! This is Heng.
</p>
<p>
To date (2023 Fall), I have about 3 years direct DS/ML experience in companies such as Apple and Square. I helped the companies launched new hardware products more efficiently by leveraging data science and various machine learning / deep learning tools. Outside of directly working with product partners, I am also motivated and capable of diving deep to research and development in latest advancement in ML and data science.
</p>
<p>
Two out of the many things that I am fascinated about data science and machine learning are
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Excitement of researching into many problem domains (maybe completely new ones as well)</li>
  <li>Ownership of products which enables me to see problem-solving from concept to production</li>
</ul>

<p>
Happy to connect and solve problems together!

This blog serves as the portfolio showcasing the projects I have encountered in the "sublime seas". In addition, I will also keep track of any tips and tricks I learned, with the intention of hopefully benefiting others.
