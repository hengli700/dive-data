<p>
  Hi there! My name is Heng Li. Before starting this journey as a data scientist, I have been a Research Scientist helping businesses from early-stage start-ups to public-traded companies. I enjoy learning new knowledge and tools, and at the same time diving deep as needed to find solutions.
</p>
<p>
  I have Master's degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia Tech</a> and Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/" target="_blank">Northeastern University</a> specialized in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_materials_science" target="_blank">Computational Materials Science</a>. 
</p>

<p>
  To date, data science has been a great tool throughout my career, in analyzing molecular interactions during research, designing experiments, as well as extracting insights to help businesses succeed.

>Ralph Waldo Emerson

This blog serves as the portfolio showcasing the projects I have encountered in the "sublime seas". In addition, I will also keep track of any tips and tricks I learned, with the intention of hopefully benefiting others.
